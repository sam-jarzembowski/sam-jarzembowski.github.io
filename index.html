                <h2>Vivaldi's The Four Seasons</h2>
                <h3>OCT 14-16 FRI-SAT 7:30 SUN 1:00</h3>
                <p>Symphonic bliss awaits you as your Colorado Symphony and guest conductor Aram Demirjian present a
                    powerhouse program highlighted by Vivaldi's programmatic masterpiece, The Four Seasons. As striking
                    and admired as ever, this work conjures imagery that deftly captures the essence of spring, summer,
                    autumn, and winter through music that manages to remain strikingly modern three centuries after its
                    debut. Paul Huang is just the virtuoso to embrace this beloved concerto in its return to Boettcher Concert
                    Hall.
                    The grand finale — Tchaikovsky's Fourth Symphony — is a meticulously structured meditation on fate
                    that endures as one of his most popular and identifiable compositions. Over four movements,
                    Tchaikovsky transforms his personal battle with fate into one of humanity's most powerful works of art.
                    Among today's best and brightest composers, Jessie Montgomery's Strum draws on the spirit of dance,
                    movement, and American folk expressions in an ecstatic celebration that will have you on the edge of
                    your seat.

                <h2>Beethoven Symphony No. 3 with Peter Oundjian</h2>
                <h3>NOV 4-6 FRI-SAT 7:30 SUN 1:00</h3>
                <p>History is replete with turning points and with the completion of his revolutionary Third Symphony,
                    Beethoven forever changed the idea of what a symphony could be. A clear bridging of the Classical and
                    Romantic eras, the Eroica (“Heroic”) Symphony explores what it means to be human in a work that is
                    larger and more emotional than a symphony had ever been before. In it, Beethoven's passion rises to the
                    forefront, using broad strokes of sound to convey the very nature of humanity, while reimagining a future
                    for music filled with endless possibility. Cellist Sterling Elliott — a 2021 Avery Fisher Career Grant
                    recipient — brings youthful energy to Elgar's Cello Concerto, a deeply emotional work filled with soaring
                    themes and quiet anguish that will leave audiences entranced. The Colorado Symphony Chorus takes
                    center stage on Vaughan Williams' Walt Whitman-inspired Toward the Unknown Region, a remarkable
                    marriage of music and text, with Williams' inspired music perfectly encapsulating Whitman's noble,
                    humanistic aspirations. These works will spring to life in the hands of Maestro Peter Oundjian and your
                    Colorado Symphony.

                <h2>Tchaikovsky Piano Concerto No. 1 with Olga Kern</h2>
                <h3>DEC 2-4 FRI-SAT 7:30 SUN 1:00</h3>
                <p>Peter Ilyich Tchaikovsky — so highly regarded for his symphonic compositions — placed himself among
                    the greats of the keyboard with the completion of his First Piano Concerto. The work is filled with
                    towering grandeur, gorgeously lyrical melodies, and unmistakable Romantic spirit. For pianists what
                    Everest is to climbers, the Concerto in B-flat has become the standard against which all virtuosos must
                    measure themselves, featuring iconic opening flourishes and a pyrotechnics-filled finale. Denver favorite
                    Olga Kern lends her dazzling technique and innate musicality to this cornerstone of the Classical Canon.
                    Your Colorado Symphony and Conductor Christian Reif — dubbed a “remarkable talent” by the San
                    Francisco Chronicle — conclude the program with Shostakovich's stormy and brooding Tenth
                    Symphony. Written to symbolize the power of the people, Shostakovich employs memorable themes and
                    complex orchestrations that mirror his own battles against Soviet oppression. Ending on a triumphant
                    note, this is a finale that will leave you breathless.

                <h2>Ravel's Daphnis et Chloé</h2>
                <h3>JAN13-15 FRI-SAT 7:30 SUN 1:00</h3>
                <p>Be still my heart! A whirling celebration of pagan love awaits listeners with Ravel's Daphnis et Chloé,
                    which he called a “symphonie chorégraphique” rather than a ballet, reflecting a sense of powerful,
                    dramatic music which defies category and springs to life on terms all its own. Ravel’s exceptional score
                    creates a sensuous atmosphere with a lingering explosiveness residing just underneath the surface. Scored
                    for a massive orchestra and utilizing the ethereal, intangible tones of a wordless chorus, Ravel often
                    spotlights solo players in a way that recalls chamber music rather than merely using it as a show of force,
                    pulling listeners into a vast, visceral dreamscape of shimmering colors and hypnotic motion.
                    Szymanowski’s First Violin Concerto will shine in the hands of Concertmaster Yumi Hwang-Williams,
                    who brings expressive virtuosity to one of the first violin concertos of the modern era. The program opens
                    with Lili Boulanger’s D
                    ’un matin de printemps, meaning ‘On a spring morning, ’capturing the genius of
                    this prodigious composer who wrote over 50 compositions before tragically passing at the age of just 24.
                    This sweet and playful ode to spring is just the transportive overture to carry away your winter doldrums.
