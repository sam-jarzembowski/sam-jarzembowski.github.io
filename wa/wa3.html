                <h2>Early Life and Education</h2>
                <p>
                    Rapp was born on January 10, 2000. 
                    She attended high school at Hopewell High School in Huntersville, North Carolina, for three years, performing in the theater program and playing on the varsity women's golf team before transferring to Northwest School of the Arts. 
                    Corey Mitchell, Rapp's theater teacher, said Rapp "has a special distinction...There is a difference when that vocal ability is coupled with sincere emotions that can move an audience and that literally can excite an audience". 
                    In 2018, Rapp won the Best Actress award at the Blumey Awards, Charlotte's premiere musical theater awards, for her portrayal of Sandra in her school's production of Big Fish.
                    Rapp then attended the tenth annual Jimmy Awards in New York City, where she ultimately won "Best Performance by an Actress", beating forty other competitors for the award.
                    This win earned her a $10,000 scholarship. Actress Laura Benanti, who presented the award to Rapp, said, "I will never be as confident as that 18-year-old". 
                    Additionally, the New York Magazine coverage of the Jimmy Awards claimed that Rapp "set the stage ablaze" with her winning performance, "prompting the stars of Mean Girls to collectively start sleeping with one eye open".
