    <h1>Changelog</h1>

    <h2>Page 1</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Item 3 was lacking a closing list tag, so I added a closing tag to fix it.</li>
        <li>"This div contains a nested paragraph." was lacking a closing tag, so I added a closing tag to fix it.</li>
        <li>Cell 3 was lacking a closing tag, so I added a closing tag to fix it.</li>
        <li>The image path was not written correctly. I updated it to "../html-midterm/img/image.png", which properly links the image.</li>
        <li>The table was not working properly, since it was missing two separate closing tags. I added /tr and /table to fix it.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Page 2</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Used "strong" to bold New Beehive Inn, since b is not the proper way to do so.</li>
