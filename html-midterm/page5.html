    <h1>Changelog</h1>

    <h2>Page 1</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>The code was missing language, charset, and meta components, so I added in the default code for those.</li>
        <li>Item 3 was lacking a closing list tag, so I added a closing tag to fix it.</li>
        <li>"This div contains a nested paragraph." was lacking a closing tag, so I added a closing tag to fix it.</li>
        <li>Cell 3 was lacking a closing tag, so I added a closing tag to fix it.</li>
        <li>The image path was not written correctly. I updated it to "../html-midterm/img/image.png", which properly links the image.</li>
        <li>The table was not working properly, since it was missing two separate closing tags. I added /tr and /table to fix it.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Page 2</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>I used "strong" to bold New Beehive Inn, since b is not the proper way to do so.</li>
        <li>The first paragraph was not indented like the rest of the code, so I updated it to match.</li>
        <li>I added horizontal lines (hr) to the "Closure" heading because it didn't have one but the others did.</li>
        <li>I removed the b tags from a heading, since that doesn't actually do anything.</li>
        <li>I changed the "History" heading to h2 (was h6) to match the rest of the page and added a closing tag that it lacked.</li>
        <li>I changed the "Interior" heading to h3 (was h2) to match the desired formatting on the Wikipedia page.</li>
        <li>I fixed two broken links for bay and segmental arch, linking to their Wikipedia pages.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Page 3</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>The code was lacking the Doctype HTML line, so I added it.</li>
        <li>The HTMl did not specify a language; I set it to English.</li>
        <li>The HTML lacked title, meta, and CSS linking, so I added a title and meta, and then linked to the corresponding CSS file.</li>
        <li>Even though the required fixes aren't in CSS, I updated the footer settings in the CSS file to have auto width and relative position for it to look better.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Page 4</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>The code was lacking a Doctype HTML specification, so I added one.</li>
        <li>In order to have content displayed properly and in order, I had to rearrange the images so that each of the three rows (tr) has one image from each category.</li>
        <li>Two of the images in the table were lacking td elements, so I added them.</li>
        <li>The images were missing alt attributes, so I added in alt text based on the image contents.</li>
    </ul>
